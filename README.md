#And some thoughts on metadata collection and refinement:

- what a great new experience to be here on GitHub sharing the links to my DH projects this semester and some thoughts...
- every class is a new discovery, this week, thanks to this reading:

Smithies, James, Carina Westling, Anna-Maria Sichani, Pam Mellen, and Arianna Ciula. "Managing 100 Digital Humanities Projects: Digital scholarship and archiving in King’s Digital Lab." Digital Humanities Quarterly 13, no. 1 (2019).

I discovered that data decay! Software and files erode... I am not sure even why I am so surprised as with every update, new Windows, the new OS, it should be obvious.
But, up to know, to be honest, I took these aspects of 'passing' in a 0-1 world for granted.
I guess nothing is forever, also the digital stuff we create, and this thought ought to accompany us when we deal with metadata.
Thinking about the future user of that metadata tomorrow, ten years from now, or maybe even 10k years away.
Another is that perhaps it is good to let things go — perhaps like with butterflies, there is some beauty in ephemera… after all, butterflies create the butterfly effect :-)
